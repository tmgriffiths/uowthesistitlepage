ABOUT
This Package redefines the \maketitle command for LaTeX documents and generates a title page for a UOW thesis in accordance with the uow branding guidelines. Use this package with the book class to typeset your thesis (it will work with report though if you do so desire). The package also provides the \declaration command. This typesets the declaration (below) that this thesis is your own work, required in the front of each PhD Thesis.
