./thesispreamble.tex:17: LaTeX Error: \usepackage before \documentclass.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.17 \usepackage{
                 geometry}
\usepackage may only appear in the document preamble, i.e.,
between \documentclass and \begin{document}.

./thesispreamble.tex:18: Undefined control sequence.
l.18 	\geometry
               {a4paper,inner=4cm, outer=2cm, top=3cm, bottom=2cm}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.


./thesispreamble.tex:18: LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

You're in trouble here.  Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.
