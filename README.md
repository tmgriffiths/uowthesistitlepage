## This is the README for uowthesistitlepage.sty Version 2.0, 2014-01-07

### ABOUT
This Package redefines the `\maketitle` command for LaTeX documents and generates a title page for a UOW thesis in accordance with the uow branding guidelines. Use this package with the book class to typeset your thesis (it will work with report though if you do so desire). The package also provides the `\declaration` command. This typesets the declaration (see below) that your thesis/dissertation/report is your own work, required in the front of each PhD Thesis.

The `uowthesistitlepage.sty` style file **is not** a complete thesis template or document class, it only typesets the title page (honours thesis by default) and declaration. The directory `thesis_template` contains a template thesis document that can be used as a basis for your document.

### Required Packages
- setspace
- etoolbox
- graphicx 
- geometry

   \usepackage[]{uowthesistitlepage}`
